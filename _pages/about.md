I am currently an Assistant Professor at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Hong Kong Institute of Science & Innovation, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([CAIR, HKISI_CAS](https://www.cair-cas.org.hk/)). 
Before that, I received my B.E. degree from the School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering at Beihang University in 2016,
and received my Ph.D. degree at the Center of Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of [Prof. Tieniu Tan](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/tnt/tnt.htm) and [Prof. Zhaoxiang Zhang](https://zhaoxiangzhang.net/).
My research interests include computer vision and machine learning. Specifically, I am curious about open problems in scene understanding, self-supervised concept discovery, and multi-modal perception in open worlds.
